The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The IKEv2 hybrid key exchange is using the traditional Diffie-Hellman groups CURVE_25519 and
ECP_256_BP, respectively in a first round, followed by a Quantum-Save Key Exchange with the
lattice-based QSKE_NEWHOPE_L1 and isogeny-based QSKE_SIKE_L1 mechanisms, respectively.
<p>
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload.
The gateway <b>moon</b> assigns virtual IP addresses from the pool 10.3.0.0/28 in a monotonously
increasing order.
